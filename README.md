This C program implements a Hospital Management System using a linked list to manage patient records with features such as adding, searching, deleting, and displaying patients. Each patient record stores details like ID, name, age, gender, and medical condition, and the data is persistently stored in a text file (patients.txt) for future use. The system allows users to interact via a menu-driven interface where new patients can be added and saved to the file, existing patients can be searched by ID, records can be deleted, and all patients can be displayed. It also supports file handling for loading and saving records, as well as proper memory management for freeing dynamically allocated structures, making it a simple yet efficient solution for managing hospital patient data.
